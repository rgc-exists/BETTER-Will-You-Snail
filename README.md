YOU CAN JOIN THE [BWYS DISCORD](https://discord.gg/J8tFyjJHbF) FOR THE LATEST NEWS ON THE PROGRESS  ON UPDATES AFTER THE MOD COMES OUT. You might also want to ask for the @notifications role if you want to get pinged for announcements... Be warned, though, I'm "announcing" literally every small feature I add. (Exaggeration, but still, it's a lot of pings. :P)

PS: For some reason it's a trend in the Will You Snail community as of the time I'm writing this to impersonate me, RGC Exists... Don't fall for it lol.
